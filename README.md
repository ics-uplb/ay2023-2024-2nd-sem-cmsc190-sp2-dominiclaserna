# Streamlining Real Estate Management in the Philippines: Development of a Web-Based Solution for Day-to-Day Operations
Authors: Luis Dominic B. Laserna and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

A web-based application for managing real estate
operation was created for use by landlords and tenants of
apartments, dormitories, and similar properties, in order to
handle their day-to-day operations more efficiently. The system
allows tracking of financial transactions, communication between
tenants and landlords, and contactless property management.
Two user types, tenant, and manager, were created and different
features were implemented for each user type allowing the
application to cater to the needs of both user types. The
application obtained a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of
79.5 showing that users found it effective and usable.
