Authors: Luis Dominic B. Laserna and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

 In this paper, a web-based application for managing
real estate in the Philippines is created. The goal is to create
an online platform for landlords and tenants of apartments,
dormitories, and similar properties to handle their day-to-day
operations. The system will allow managers to track payments
and communicate with tenants, tenants will be able to view their
transactions and pay bills while managers will be able to keep
track of those transactions. The system aims to enable contactless
property management for all parties involved.
